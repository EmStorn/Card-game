		  <p>The final goal is to eliminate all the cards from the pyramid.
			 You have to select maximum two cards. The sum of the cards value must be 10.
			 It can be achieved by matching for example 2 and 8. But also by a single 10.
			 By clicking on the deck you can put on the board additional cards, to help matching.
			 You can select only uncovered cards. To uncover a new card, you need to match the 2 card covering it.

			 As the cards are randomly shuffled, it's not alway possible to win.
